  /// Method to update firmware.
  ///
  /// [device]: The Bluetooth device to update firmware on.
  /// [updateType]: The type of update operation.
  /// [firmwareType]: The type of firmware to update.
  /// [uri]: The file path or URL of the firmware binary (optional). Required for
  ///   every [FirmwareType] except [FirmwareType.filepicker].
  /// [mtuSize]: The chunk size (in bytes) used to split the firmware into
  ///   packets sent to the device (optional). Must be at least 1 and not exceed
  ///   the BLE single-write limit: [maxMtuSize] (512) for [UpdateType.espidf],
  ///   or [maxMtuSize] - [arduinoHeaderSize] (510) for [UpdateType.arduino],
  ///   which adds a 2-byte packet header. When
  ///   [IntegrityFeature.packetCrc16] is enabled, [crc16Size] more bytes are
  ///   reserved on the wire, shrinking the maximum by 2. Out-of-range values
  ///   are rejected.
  /// [integrity]: Optional firmware integrity features (SHA-256 before
  ///   transfer, per-packet CRC-16, post-flash SHA-256). Defaults to
  ///   [FirmwareIntegrityConfig.none]. Enable only what the device firmware
  ///   supports — features combine freely.

  /// [percentageStream].

  /// IMPORTANT: Cancelling only stops the app from sending data; it does NOT
  /// reset the OTA state machine on the ESP32, which is left mid-update. The
  /// caller MUST disconnect and reconnect (re-discovering services) before
  /// starting a new OTA on the same device. Starting another OTA on the same
  /// connection leaves the two sides out of sync and typically results in a BLE
  /// disconnect / GATT error.

  /// you normally do NOT need to call this. Use it only to abandon an update
  /// that has not finished (e.g. on app shutdown). The instance must not be
  /// used after disposing.
